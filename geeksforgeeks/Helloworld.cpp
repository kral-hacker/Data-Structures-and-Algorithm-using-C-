#include <iostream> //include is used to include all the contents from the mentioned file
//In this it is including the standard iostream file for decalarations foe input and output library functions
using namespace std;
//It is used to import the std namespace to the current namespace
//Using std namespace is a bad practice
int main(){//entry point for every c++ program
    cout<<"Hello World!";
    //cout is used to print the statements
